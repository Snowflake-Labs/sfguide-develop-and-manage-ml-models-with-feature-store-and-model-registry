# Develop and Manage ML Models with Feature Store and Model Registry

## Overview

This notebook demonstrates an end-to-end ML experiment cycle including feature creation, training data generation, model training and inference. The workflow touches on key Snowflake ML features including [Snowflake Feature Store](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-ml/feature-store/overview), [Dataset](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-ml/dataset), ML Lineage, [Snowpark ML Modeling](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-ml/modeling) and [Snowflake Model Registry](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/snowpark-ml/model-registry/overview).
